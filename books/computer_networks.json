    "title": "What Is a Computer Network?",
    "math": "Graph theory",
    "note": "This section provides a fundamental definition of a computer network as a set of interconnected computers and devices that can share resources (like printers) and data. It explains the core purpose of networking, which is to enable communication and collaboration."

    "n": 2,
    "title": "Network Types by Scale: LAN, MAN, and WAN",
    "math": "Geographical scale",
    "note": "This lesson categorizes networks based on their geographical size. It defines a Local Area Network (LAN) for a small area like a home or office, a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) for a city, and a Wide Area Network (WAN) for a large geographical area, with the Internet being the largest WAN."

    "title": "Network Topologies",
    "math": "Network topology",
    "note": "This section explains the concept of network topology as the arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network. It covers the main physical topologies: Bus, Star (the most common in modern LANs), Ring, and Mesh."

    "title": "The Concept of Layered Architecture",
    "math": "Abstraction layers",
    "note": "This lesson introduces the principle of a layered architecture in networking. It explains that the complex task of networking is broken down into smaller, more manageable parts called layers. Each layer provides a specific service to the layer above it and is responsible for a distinct set of tasks, promoting modularity and interoperability."
  },
  {
    "n": 5,
    "title": "The OSI and TCP/IP Models",
    "math": "Reference models",
    "note": "This section introduces the two primary reference models for networking. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a 7-layer conceptual model. The TCP/IP model is a 4 or 5-layer model that is the practical basis for the modern Internet. The layers of each model are listed and their purposes are briefly described."
  },
  {
    "n": 6,
    "title": "Encapsulation and Decapsulation",
    "math": "Data encapsulation",
    "note": "This lesson explains the process of data encapsulation. As data passes down through the layers of a sending host, each layer adds its own header (and sometimes a trailer) containing control information. This process is reversed at the receiving host (decapsulation) as the data moves up the layers."
  },
  {
    "n": 7,
    "title": "Layer 1: The Physical Layer",
    "math": "Signal transmission",
    "note": "This section details the role of the Physical Layer, which is responsible for the actual transmission of raw bits over a physical medium. It deals with the physical characteristics of the medium, such as the type of cable (e.g., twisted-pair, fiber optic) and the voltage levels for 0s and 1s."

    "n": 8,
    "title": "Layer 2: The Data Link Layer",
    "math": "Framing and error detection",
    "note": "This lesson explains the role of the Data Link Layer, which is to provide reliable, node-to-node data transfer. Its main responsibilities are 'framing' (grouping bits into frames), physical addressing using MAC addresses, and error detection to identify corrupted frames."
  },
  {
    "n": 9,
    "title": "MAC Addresses and Ethernet",
    "math": "Physical addressing",
    "note": "This section introduces the Media Access Control (MAC) address as a unique, hard-coded address for a network interface card (NIC). It explains how MAC addresses are used for communication within a single local network (LAN). Ethernet is presented as the dominant Data Link Layer technology for LANs."
  },
  {
    "n": 10,
    "title": "Network Switches",
    "math": "Network switching",
    "note": "This lesson explains the function of a network switch, a key Data Link Layer device. Unlike a hub (a Physical Layer device that broadcasts data to all ports), a switch intelligently forwards frames only to the specific port connected to the destination MAC address, improving efficiency and reducing collisions."
  },
  {
    "n": 11,
    "title": "Layer 3: The Network Layer",
    "math": "Logical addressing and routing",
    "note": "This section details the role of the Network Layer, which is responsible for the source-to-destination delivery of packets across multiple networks. Its two main functions are logical addressing (using IP addresses) and routing (determining the best path for packets to travel)."
  },
  {
    "n": 12,
    "title": "The Internet Protocol (IP) and IPv4 Addresses",
    "math": "IP addressing",
    "note": "This lesson introduces the Internet Protocol (IP) as the primary protocol of the Network Layer. It focuses on the structure of an IPv4 address (a 32-bit number) and explains how it provides a unique logical address for every device on the Internet. The concept of a subnet mask is also introduced."

    "title": "Routers: The Workhorses of the Internet",
    "math": "Routing algorithms",
    "note": "This section explains the function of a router, the primary Network Layer device. A router connects different networks together and uses routing tables and routing algorithms (like RIP and OSPF) to make decisions about forwarding packets toward their final destination."

    "n": 14,
    "title": "Layer 4: The Transport Layer",
    "math": "Process-to-process communication",
    "note": "This lesson explains the role of the Transport Layer, which provides logical communication between processes running on different hosts. It introduces the concept of port numbers, which are used to identify the specific application process that data is intended for on a destination machine."
  },
  {
    "n": 15,
    "title": "The User Datagram Protocol (UDP)",
    "math": "Connectionless protocols",
    "note": "This section covers UDP, a simple, connectionless Transport Layer protocol. UDP provides a best-effort delivery service with no reliability, flow control, or error correction. It is fast and suitable for applications where speed is more important than reliability, such as video streaming or online gaming."
  },
  {
    "n": 16,
    "title": "The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)",
    "math": "Connection-oriented protocols",
    "note": "This lesson details TCP, a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that forms the backbone of most internet communication.

    "n": 17,
    "title": "TCP Flow and Congestion Control",
    "math": "Sliding window protocol",
    "note": "This section dives deeper into TCP's reliability features. It explains Flow Control, which prevents a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver, and Congestion Control, which helps the network as a whole prevent and recover from traffic overload."

    "title": "Layer 5: The Application Layer",
    "math": "Application-layer protocols",

  },
  {
    "n": 19,
    "title": "The Domain Name System (DNS)",
    "math": "Distributed databases",
    "note": "This lesson explains DNS as the 'phonebook of the Internet'. It is a distributed database system that translates human-readable domain names (like `www.google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (like `172.217.10.142`), which are required for locating computer services and devices worldwide."

    "title": "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)",
    "math": "Client-server protocols",
    "note": "This section introduces HTTP as the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It explains the request-response model, where a client (like a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server, which then returns an HTTP response containing the requested resource (like an HTML page)."

  {
    "n": 21,
    "title": "Network Security: Firewalls and VPNs",
    "math": "Network security",
    "note": "This final lesson provides an overview of key network security technologies. It explains how Firewalls act as a barrier to filter malicious traffic.
